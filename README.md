# ðŸ“§ Spam Text Filtering with Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates how to build a **spam text message classifier** using the **Naive Bayes algorithm**. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to clean and process text data, and uses machine learning to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Spam_Text_Filtering_with_Naive_Bayes_.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the full code for preprocessing, modeling, training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Preprocessing of raw SMS text (stopword removal, stemming, tokenization)
- Vectorization using **TF-IDF**
- Classification using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix)
- Visualizations for insights into the dataset and model results

---

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is a collection of SMS messages labeled as **spam** or **ham**. It contains two columns:

- `label`: The class of the message (spam or ham)
- `message`: The text of the SMS

> Note: The dataset is loaded directly in the notebook and assumed to be in a file named `spam.csv`.
